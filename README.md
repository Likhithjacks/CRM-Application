# CRM-Application
In this project, I built a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application using Node.js and MongoDB that allows
customers to create tickets and track the status of their requests. The application includes features such as a ticket management system, where 
customers can create, view, and update their tickets, and receive notifications about the status of their requests via email. The Node.js server handles 
routing, data processing and communicates with the MongoDB database to retrieve and update ticket information using JWT authentication and 
bcrypt for hashing the password. The application also includes an email notification system with a CRON job, which sends updates to customers 
about the status of their tickets. The project demonstrates my ability to create a comprehensive ticket management system that integrates with a CRM 
solution using Node.js, MongoDB and email notifications, and my understanding of best practices for customer service and communication.
